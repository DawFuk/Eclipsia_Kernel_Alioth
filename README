Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

# Linux kernel backports package

This package provides backport support for drivers from newer kernels
down to older kernels. It currently backports the following subsystems:

  * Wireless
  * NFC
  * WWAN

This package provides the latest Linux kernel subsystem enhancements
for kernels 3.10 and above.

# Documentation

This package is documented online and has more-up-to date information
online than on this README file. You should read the wiki page
and not rely on this README!

https://backports.wiki.kernel.org

# License

This work is a subset of the Linux kernel as such we keep the kernel's
Copyright practice. Some files have their own copyright and in those
cases the license is mentioned in the file. All additional work made
to building this package is licensed under the GPLv2.

# Backporting preference for EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() and proprietary drivers

This framework was designed by intent since its inception *only* for upstream
Linux kernel drivers to avoid excuses about the difficulty to support upstream
Linux kernel development while also supporting users on older kernels. To
ensure the intent is respected currently all symbols that we do work on to
backport are exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() as we do work to backport them
for the supported kernels. By using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() we make it *clear* that
if you use the backported symbols your software *is* considered derivative
works of the Linux kernel.

Comprendes, Mendes?
